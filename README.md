## Features

- Interactive era selector that transforms the entire UI
- Four distinct design periods with authentic styling:
  - **1990s**: Bright colors, blinking text, marquees (Neon Genesis Evangelion)
  - **Early 2000s**: Gradients, glossy buttons, skeuomorphic elements (Naruto)
  - **2010s**: Flat design, minimalism, subtle animations (Attack on Titan)
  - **2020s**: Glassmorphism, neumorphism, floating elements (Demon Slayer)
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes

## How It Works

The application uses JavaScript to toggle between different design eras when the user selects an option from the dropdown menu. Each era has its own CSS styling that gets applied to the entire page, transforming the look and feel to match the design trends of that period.

Key implementation features:
- CSS variables for consistent theming
- CSS animations for era-specific effects
- JavaScript event listeners for interactive elements
- Dynamic class toggling to switch between eras

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
2. Use the "Choose Era" dropdown at the top to switch between different design periods
3. Explore the visual elements, interactive components, and design characteristics of each era

Some visual effects may not appear correctly in older browsers.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for this project:

- Create additional eras (80s, future)
- Add a timeline visualization of web design evolution
- Implement more complex animations for modern eras
